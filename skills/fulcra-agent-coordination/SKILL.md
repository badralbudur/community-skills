# Fulcra Agent Coordination

The coordination layer over [`fulcra-agent-teams`](https://github.com/fulcradynamics/agent-skills). Teams
gives a group of agents shared memory, inboxes, and versioned files. This skill adds what teams
deliberately leaves out: **presence** (who is alive right now), **roles** (durable functions held by lease,
not by session), **continuity** (structured snapshots and a deterministic resume brief), **review** (an
N-reviewer verdict tally), **directives** (directed work with priorities and acks), and **health** (is
anything actually running, and which host went dark).

The through-line: anything two agents must agree on is a **fold over derived state**, computed by the
engine, rather than a prose instruction telling each agent to compare timestamps and reach its own
conclusion. Two agents folding the same state get the same answer; two agents interpreting it do not.

## Invoking the engine

The engine ships with this skill at `scripts/coord-engine` — stdlib-only Python 3, no install step and no
dependencies to resolve. Every command in this skill is spelled `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine …`, where
`<skill-dir>` is this skill's directory.

```bash
<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine --help     # the verb list
<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine doctor <team>   # preflight: tooling + store reachability
```

Writes go to the Fulcra File Store, so the storage CLI must be authenticated (`fulcra-api auth login`).
`doctor` checks exactly that.

## These are layers, not alternatives

Teams is the base. The six below are **optional layers on top of it**, not competing options to choose
between — they share one engine and one team namespace, and they compose: broadcasts use the presence
roster; role vacancy escalates through directives; handoff writes a continuity checkpoint; health reports
on whatever reconcile schedule you run. Adopt the whole thing and use what your situation calls for.

Each layer degrades cleanly when a layer it likes is absent, and says so where it matters: `briefing` on a
cold team prints empty sections rather than failing; a broadcast without presence still hides acked items
per-agent, it just can't tell you when everyone has seen it. Nothing here requires you to decide up front
which layers you are "installing".

There is no need to read all six references. Run the probe that matches your question and read the
reference it points at.

## Router

`<you>` is your agent id (see [presence](references/presence.md) on picking one). Probes are read-only.

| Probe | Command | Passes when | If it fails, read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Is the engine reaching the store? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine doctor <team>` | exit 0 | [health.md](references/health.md) |
| Cold start — what is this team's state? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine briefing <team> --agent <you>` | exit 0; prints the presence/board/inbox/needs-me sections (empty sections are a pass) | [continuity.md](references/continuity.md) |
| Who is alive right now? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine presence show <team> --json` | your row shows `"liveness": "live"` | [presence.md](references/presence.md) |
| Does anyone hold this role? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine roles status <team> <role> --json` | exit 0 and `"status": "HELD"`; exit 1 means the transport is degraded and the role's state is unknown — retry rather than treating it as `VACANT` | [roles.md](references/roles.md) |
| Can I resume what I left? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine continuity resume <team> <you>` | prints an objective and next actions | [continuity.md](references/continuity.md) |
| Do I have directed work waiting? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine inbox <team> --agent <you> --json` | exit 0 and a JSON array with no leading `inbox-degraded` row (that row means transport, not an empty inbox) | [directives.md](references/directives.md) |
| Is this artifact cleared to land? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine review status <team> <slug> --json` | `"state": "APPROVED"` with empty `pending_required`; exit 1 means the tally is unknown — retry rather than treating it as unapproved | [review.md](references/review.md) |
| Is anything actually reconciling this team? | `<skill-dir>/scripts/coord-engine health <team> --json` | exit 0 and `"healthy": true` | [health.md](references/health.md) |

## What's yours to decide

Where a decision belongs to you rather than to the skill, the references mark it **User's call:** and stop
there. The engine computes state; it does not hold opinions about how you run a team. The recurring ones:

- **Heartbeat cadence** — how often agents beat presence and how often reconcile runs. Everything downstream
  (roster freshness, inbox lag, health's STALE flag) is bounded by what you pick.
- **Which roles exist**, their `policy` (`shared`/`exclusive`), `sla_hours`, and maintainer. There is no
  built-in vocabulary and no default org chart.
- **Whether an unattended operator loop runs** at all — draining inboxes, storing digests, sweeping
  vacancies — or whether a human drives it.
- **What review gates** in your process, and whether required reviewers are roles or named agents.
- **Snapshot cadence**, and whether sessions end with `continuity park` or a bare snapshot.
