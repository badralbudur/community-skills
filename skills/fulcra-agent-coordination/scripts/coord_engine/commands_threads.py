"""coord-engine dropped-threads command — the `threads` fold (fulcra-agent).

Extracted verbatim from ``cli.py`` (behavior-preserving module split): the bus
adapter for ``threads.classify`` (candidate rows + principal-activity attribution +
intent windows) and ``cmd_threads``. The window/budget knobs parse through the
one shared ``config.env_float`` policy (``_threads_window`` carries the flag>env
delegator form). Shared cli-level helpers (``_now``/``_iso`` and the task/ack/
responses path helpers, ``_load_rows_status``) are reached through the ``cli``
module so ``monkeypatch.setattr(cli, "_now", …)`` still steers them and there is
no module-load cycle. Dispatch stays wired in ``cli.build_parser``; every public
name here (incl. the ``DEFAULT_THREADS_*`` knobs) is re-exported from ``cli``.
