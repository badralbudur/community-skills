    ``inbox``/``listen``/every canonical surface reads the reconcile-built summaries
    index, so a task/directive doc written between reconciles is invisible to all of
    them until the next heartbeat rebuild. The invariant that breaks without this:
    a surface read must never report "nothing waiting" for work that is already
    durably written — otherwise a poller misses fresh work for up to a whole
    reconcile period, and the newer the work, the longer it hides. When the index is
    present+readable we also list the task dir once and parse only docs whose slug is
    absent from the index (bounded by new-since-reconcile items — typically zero or a
    handful — and hard-capped at ``COORD_OVERLAY_CAP``), unioning them into the fold.
    Rows already in the index are not re-read: the index row wins, so this is
    behavior-preserving for every summarized doc.

    Returns ``(overlay_rows, ok, reason)``. ``ok`` flips False — degrading the inbox
    source visibly, never silent, while the index rows are still served — when:
      * the task-dir listing raised (the overlay's view is unknown);
      * a listed absent doc could not be read (None/raise): the listing just proved
        the doc exists, so an unreadable read is a transport problem, not a
        sanctioned skip — silently dropping it is the false-clear class this branch
        kills, at the overlay's own read step;
      * the absent set exceeded the cap (truncated — served subset is deterministic:
        absent names are read in sorted order, so every agent converges on the same
        served subset; the reason carries {served, absent_total});
      * the ``COORD_OVERLAY_BUDGET`` deadline expired with docs still unread (the
        cap bounds read count, this bounds time — slow per-doc reads must not
        starve a surface read/watcher tick; checked after each read, the after-op
        discipline). Everything read so far is still served. When both the budget
        and the cap trip, the budget reason wins (it is the truthful one — the cap
        wasn't what stopped us).
    Parse-garbage / not-a-Task docs remain sanctioned silent skips (mirrors
    reconcile's own tolerance). Cost: one extra ``list_dir`` per row load, plus one

# loud, never silently indistinguishable from "nothing to do". The hazard this

    it holds a fresh lease on. Best-effort: the top listing failing yields []

    The scan is bounded. Without a bound, a degraded transport turns it into a
    hang long enough to be mistaken for an unreachable store. Two guards apply:

    - **Settled-skip.** Each unsettled review costs one verdicts listing, a doc
      read, and a read per verdict. Once a review is terminally approved with no
      outstanding required reviewers, a ``.settled`` marker is dropped in the
      verdicts prefix; the listing this fold already does then reveals it, and the
      slug is skipped without further reads. The fold drops that marker the first
      time it computes such a tally, so settled history stops costing.

    - **Aggregate budget.** A wall-clock deadline (default 45s, env
      ``COORD_REVIEW_FOLD_BUDGET``) checked between slugs. On breach the scan
      stops and a ``review-fold-degraded`` marker (``scanned``/``total``) is
      appended, so the result is never a clean-looking partial. A slug whose
      tally raises ``TransportError`` or whose review doc read returns None
      (``read()`` never raises — None means the read failed, since the slug came
      from the listing) is skipped, counted in ``skipped``, and surfaced through
      the same marker: an unreadable slug is unknown, neither settled nor
      silently pending, and partial knowledge must stay visible.

    deliberate identity deviation from the plain directive path: an intent's
    identity is ``text + assignee only`` — ``intent_by`` (the declared window) is
    excluded from the hash-slug. Restating the same commitment with a revised
    deadline must not fork a second item, so the window cannot be part of identity;

    rule would then silently preserve a stale deadline on restatement (the

    instead (see ``_update_intent_window``). Identity = ``_directive_payload(text,
    None, None, principal)`` — summary/next_action are constant-empty, so the hash
    ranges over text + assignee exactly.

# --- listen: the await leg of `tell` -----------------------------------------
#
# The send verbs (tell/broadcast/remind) and `respond` exist, but nothing
# surfaced either new inbox directives or the responses that come back to a
# directive's owner: `respond` wrote shards no fold delivered, and `tell` had no
# reply leg. `listen` moves that id-diff into the engine so the lifecycle owns
# listening rather than each caller hand-rolling a watcher around `inbox --json`.
# Three event sources, each id-diff'd against a state file, per tick:
#   1. new inbox directives for the agent (the same fold `inbox` shows).
#   2. new responses to directives the agent owns (the reply leg).
#   3. new verdicts on reviews the agent requested (`requested_by == agent`) —
#      the await leg of `review request`, now that a verb-opened review notifies
#      its reviewers atomically, which is what makes the `await verdicts`
#      breadcrumb genuine.
#
# Five failure sources are tracked independently — inbox (summaries index),
# responses (the responses subtree transport), orphans (a response whose owning
# directive doc won't resolve), verdicts (the review root, a review doc, or a
# verdict shard unreadable), and roles (a role-lease listing unreadable while
# resolving role-routed directives). Each is its own degraded streak.
#
# Disciplines. State is add-only, which is what makes them hold:
#   * No false advance — a failed or None read during a tick must not mark
#     unknown ids as seen. State is a union of affirmatively-processed ids, so a
#     degraded read contributes nothing and recovery re-surfaces the still-pending
#     id.
#   * Fail visible, without flooding — a transport failure emits
#     `LISTEN DEGRADED:` once per consecutive-failure streak, per source. The
#     streak flags persist in the state file, so a scheduler re-running `--once`
#     does not re-alarm every tick. Per-source separation is load-bearing: a
#     single shared flag would let a chronic degradation on one source hold it set
#     forever and silence a new, distinct outage on another. Each source alerts
#     once per its own streak and resets on its own recovery. The alert goes to
#     stderr so `--json` stdout stays a clean one-object-per-line event stream for
#     streaming consumers that shouldn't need to filter.
#     A permanently-absent owner/requester doc is handled a level below the
#     streak: it is emit-once-cached per slug (`flagged_orphan_responses` /
#     `_verdicts`, like the dir-only `orphan_slugs`) and skipped silently
#     thereafter, so it never reaches its source's streak. A watcher that treats a
#     persistent degrade as fatal therefore survives a doc that will never
#     return, while a genuine transport outage on that same source still fails
#     loud.
#   * Quiet ticks print nothing to stdout — only `--verbose` emits a heartbeat,
#     and only to stderr. Anything else floods whatever is monitoring the stream.
#   * Bounded cost — one list_dir of _coord/responses/, plus per-slug work only
#     for slugs the agent owns. A slug's ownership is read once, from its task
#     doc, and cached in state, so not-owned and broadcast slugs cost nothing
#     after the first classification and the scan never grows with total history.


# The independent degraded streaks. Each source alarms once per its own streak.
# `roles` (role-lease resolution for role-routed directives) is its own source:
# folding it into `inbox` would let a chronic role degradation pin that streak
# and mask a fresh summaries outage — the independent-streak invariant. Legacy
# state files lack the key; _coerce_degraded defaults it False (free migration).

    The presence section is a team-global fan-out — one shard per agent, a
    ``list_dir`` plus one read each — a fan-out, so it must be bounded or a single
    degraded transport hangs the whole ``briefing`` with no way out but a signal.
    This mirrors the review fold discipline: the deadline is checked both before and after
    each blocking read (a single stalled read can't return a clean row — overshoot
    is bounded by one read), a listed-but-unreadable shard (read -> None) counts as
    ``skipped``, and a top-level listing failure yields ``scanned=0``. The listing
    itself is a blocking op under the same discipline: a deadline
    already spent when we get here skips the call entirely (an earlier section spent
    the budget — paying one more transport timeout of stall would re-open the hang),
    and an overrun detected after the listing surfaces the marker even when the
    listing returned [] (otherwise a slow empty listing fell through the per-shard
    loop to ``([], None)`` — a falsely-clean empty roster). On any breach/failure a
    single ``presence-degraded`` row ``{type, scanned, total[, skipped]}`` (the
