"""Environment-driven activity annotations — the pure projection fold.

``reconcile`` already computes task ``transitions`` and merges them into
``log.md``. This module projects those transitions onto the operator's Fulcra
timeline **mechanically** — from the heartbeat, model-free, platform-agnostic —
so a transition made by ANY agent/host/harness (not just one running the
in-process writer) still lands as a timeline annotation.

This file is the *fold only*: ``project(transitions, cursor, *, team, now)`` is
pure (no I/O, never raises) and deterministic. The CLI wiring, the opt-in gate,
and the actual record write (via the hardened ``fulcra_common.annotations``
writer) live in Task 2's ``cli.py``.

IDEMPOTENCY (the load-bearing property)
---------------------------------------
The typed ingest endpoint has NO server-side dedup and is async, and it silently
strips any non-served top-level key. So the fold must be idempotent on the
client:

  * every projected annotation carries a **deterministic id** keyed on
    ``(team, task_id, kind, ts)`` — a stdlib ``hashlib`` digest, NOT the builtin
    ``hash()`` (which is per-process salted and would differ across hosts/runs);
  * a **cursor** ``{last_ts, seen_ids[], seen_ts{}}`` records what's been
    projected. The ``last_ts`` watermark plus a **skew lookback** define the
    boundary: a transition is emitted iff its ``ts`` is at or after
    ``last_ts - skew_margin`` AND its id is not already in ``seen_ids``. The
    lookback (not a strict ``> last_ts``) is what lets a genuinely-new transition
    that shares the watermark's ts still land, and lets ``seen_ids`` dedup the
    replay band; ``seen_ids`` is pruned by TIME — every id whose transition ts is
    within ``skew_margin`` of the (advanced) watermark is retained, everything
    older is dropped because the boundary itself already suppresses it. The margin
    is keyed to reconcile's ``FAST_PATH_SKEW_MARGIN_SECONDS`` (the same clock-skew
    budget the fast path trusts). ``seen_ts`` carries the ts of each retained id so
    the time-prune is exact; a legacy cursor without it (or an id whose ts is
    unknown/unparseable) keeps the id defensively rather than risking a re-emit.

TRANSITION ROW SHAPE
--------------------
Each transition is a structured dict. reconcile's ``aggregate.diff_rows`` today
renders transitions as markdown *bullet strings* (``* **Update**: [t](t.md) …``)
for ``log.md``; those strings do NOT carry ``task_id`` / ``kind`` / ``ts`` /
``assignee`` / ``next_action``, which the annotation id + note require. So the
fold consumes the *structured* form of a transition — the caller (Task 2) is
responsible for producing it (by extending the diff to emit structured rows, or
by joining parsed ``log.md`` bullets back to their task rows). Required keys:

    {"task_id": str, "kind": str, "ts": str}      # ts = ISO-8601 transition time

``ts`` CONTRACT (required of Task 2's caller): ``ts`` MUST be a **normalized,
lexicographically-comparable ISO-8601 string** — UTC with a trailing ``Z``,
zero-padded fields (e.g. ``2026-07-09T09:00:00Z``). Both the watermark ordering
(a plain string ``>``) and the new skew-margin arithmetic (parse-to-datetime)
rely on this normalization; a non-normalized ts (local offset, missing padding)
can mis-order the watermark or fail to parse. Unparseable ts never crash and are
never silently dropped — they degrade to "emit / keep" — but they defeat the
margin math, so keep ts normalized upstream.

Optional keys enrich the human ``note``:

    {"title": str, "assignee": str, "next_action": str}

A row missing any required key (or not a dict) is **malformed**: skipped +
reported, never fatal, and the good rows around it still advance the cursor.

SEAM NOTE (Task 1 -> Task 2): ``kind`` / ``task_id`` on an emitted
:class:`AnnotationSpec` are writer-call **metadata**, NOT served record keys —
Task 2 must NOT forward them into the MomentAnnotation body (the closed typed
schema silently strips any non-served top-level key). They inform the write call
(tags, dedup) but the human-visible content lives entirely in ``note``.

Stdlib-only (plus the intra-package skew constant); folds pure; never crashes.
