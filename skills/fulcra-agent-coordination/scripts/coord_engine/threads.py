"""Dropped-threads classification — the PURE fold (no transport).

Answers "what work-in-progress has the principal dropped?" over a NEUTRAL row
shape a single adapter (in cli.py) produces — so adding another source later is a
new adapter emitting the same rows, never a rewrite.

A thread is dropped in exactly THREE modes; classification is MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE,
one mode per thread, FIRST MATCH WINS:

  1. **intent carve-out (mode 3)** — an item carrying an ``intent:<principal>``
     tag is ONLY EVER a mode-3 candidate: INVISIBLE until its window
     (``intent_by`` if declared, else capture + ``intent_grace_hours``) passes,
     mode 3 after — UNLESS followed up. Its assignee/age never trigger modes 1-2
     (an unripe commitment must not surface at all — the nagging-failure guard).
     Follow-up suppression (any ONE suffices): status advanced past ``proposed``;
     a response shard exists; a ``followed-up-by:<slug>`` tag is present. Carried
     on the row as ``followup: {status, responded, followup_ref}``.
  2. **blocked-on-principal (mode 2)** — a NON-intent item whose progress waits on
     the principal (``assignee: <principal>``, ``blocked-on:<principal>`` tag, or a
     ``needs:human`` block naming them). Surfaced IMMEDIATELY, no aging; being
     awaited-now dominates
     aged silence. ``evidence`` notes the age when it ALSO exceeds the silence
     window.
  3. **started-then-silent (mode 1)** — a remaining principal item (owns / last
     touched) whose principal-activity is older than the silence window. Deliberately
     parked items (``@backlog`` audience, a future ``not_before``) are excluded by
     construction.

Output object per thread: ``{mode, id, title, age, window, evidence}`` — ``age`` in
days (float; days since the mode's reference instant), ``window`` the ISO threshold
instant (mode 3 window / mode 1 silence cutoff; None for mode 2), ``evidence`` an
HONEST string naming the signals that fired and FLAGGING timestamp-fallback
attribution. The list is grouped by mode ascending, oldest-first within a mode.
