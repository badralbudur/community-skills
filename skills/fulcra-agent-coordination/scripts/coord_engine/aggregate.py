    THE INVARIANT, and why the passthrough exists: **summaries.json is ONE shared
    document written by MANY hosts at MANY versions, and any top-level key added
    in version N is silently wiped by every host older than N** — an older host
    rebuilds the document from the keys it knows about and writes the result over
    everyone else's. That is not hypothetical: v1.6.8 added the ack fold's anchor
    here, and on the live mixed fleet a v1.6.6 host (which predates the key)
    deleted it on its very next pass, holding the ack fold on its full-fold
    fallback permanently.

    So: **never rebuild this document from a fixed key set.** Preserving unknown
    keys cannot rescue us from a host that predates the passthrough itself — that
    needs the fleet on >= v1.6.9 — but it stops the same defect recurring one
    version later, when an older-but-still-preserving host meets a newer host's

# categorization (creation / status-transition / removal, keyed by task id), but
# it emits fold-ready dicts ``{task_id, kind, ts, title, assignee?, next_action?}``
# instead of markdown bullets. It is a SEPARATE function on purpose:
#
#   * ``diff_rows``' ``list[str]`` return + ``log.md`` output MUST stay
#     byte-identical (existing aggregate/reconcile tests are the guardrail), so
#     its signature is left untouched — a second return value would force every
#     caller (reconcile + the aggregate tests) to change, breaking that guarantee.
#   * The two share their categorization via ``_categorize`` (above) so they can
#     never drift on WHICH changes count as a transition: ``diff_rows`` renders
#     each ``(kind, row, prior_row)`` as a bullet, ``diff_transitions`` as a dict.

# reconcile stamps on every write (``mtime`` as a defensive fallback) — normalized
# to a UTC-``Z`` zero-padded ISO string per the Task-1 ts contract so the fold's
# watermark ordering and skew-margin arithmetic hold.

#: The store's ``file list`` mtime format(s) — UTC, minute-granular, e.g.
#: ``2026-07-01 04:12PM UTC`` (see ``transport.parse_list_output``). This is the
#: DEFENSIVE ts fallback when a task carries no ``timestamp`` frontmatter. Because
#: it carries a full date (year included), it normalizes cleanly to a UTC-``Z``
#: ISO instant — there is no ls-style yearless ambiguity to resolve, so the ts
#: contract (parseable, lexicographically comparable) holds even for a
#: timestamp-less task, keeping the fold's skew math + seen_ids prune bounded.
