"""Role status fold — the deterministic core of the fulcra-agent-roles skill.

A role's status is a fold over multiple lease files' freshness — exactly the
category that must be code, not prose an agent eyeballs (two agents must AGREE
whether a role is vacant before one escalates). Pure functions here; the I/O

    ``None`` meaning UNKNOWN — the caller must fail closed.

    The distinction this exists to draw, and the reason it is one function rather
    than three call sites:

    - **absent / blank** (key missing, ``null``, bare ``sla_hours:``, or empty
      string) -> ``DEFAULT_SLA_HOURS``. The field is OPTIONAL, and omitting it is a
      legitimate statement: "the default applies". Substituting the default here is
      honouring an intent, not guessing at one.
    - **explicitly invalid** (``abc``, ``true``, a list, negative, zero, ``inf``,
      ``nan``) -> ``None``, i.e. UNKNOWN. The operator SET this field and it does
      not parse; we cannot know what window they meant, so lease freshness is
      unknowable and no answer about it is honest.

    Running ``float(reg.get("sla_hours") or DEFAULT_SLA_HOURS)`` under a bare
    ``except`` maps BOTH cases onto the default, which inverts the module's
    load-bearing rule: an unparseable ``sla_hours: abc`` would produce a confident,
    undegraded answer about lease freshness — a lease 36h old under a doc whose
    real SLA might well be 720h folds to ``([], True)``, a clean "not a holder"
    with no ``role-degraded`` marker, silently dropping role-routed work or minting
    a false vacancy. A default is never a substitute for a value someone explicitly
    set and got wrong. Same fact-class as a failed read and a failed parse: we do not
    know, so we say so.

    Non-positive is UNKNOWN rather than honoured-literally on purpose: a 0h or
    negative window makes every lease stale forever, so treating it as intent would
    mint an escalation storm off what is, in practice, always a typo.
