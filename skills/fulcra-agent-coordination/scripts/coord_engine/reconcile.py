#: within a day, at a SIXTH of the recurring cost (72/12 = 6x less frequent;
#: the interval goes 4h -> ~24h, but the ratio is 6, not 24). The right end

ACKS_STREAK_KEY = "acks_incremental_streak"

#: Key under which the aggregate carries the ack fold's OWN anchor: the instant
#: through which acks are provably folded. The change-query window starts here.

#: Why not ``generated_at``: that anchor advances every pass, unconditionally. If
#: a pass knew a slug had changed but could not READ it, reusing generated_at
#: would consume the change — the next window would start past it and the new ack
#: would stay invisible until the periodic backstop. That is a FALSE ADVANCE (the

#: seen). This anchor advances ONLY on a fold that read everything it meant to,
#: so an unread change stays inside the next pass's window. Absent (a legacy
#: aggregate, or a pass that never got a conclusive fold) means NO anchor — a

    THE INVARIANT: the incremental path is an OPTIMIZATION, and its failure mode
    is ALWAYS "fall back to the full fold and say so" — never "assume unchanged".
    Every unknown (no change-query capability, a query error/500, feed-shape
    drift, no ``since`` anchor, an anchor too old to query, a slug the prior
    aggregate never saw, a slug we knew had changed but could not read) resolves
    to folding, not to reusing. Reuse happens only on POSITIVE evidence: the store
    answered, and it did not name this slug.

    Its COROLLARY, equally load-bearing: a fold that could not read what it meant
    to must not let the pass advance past it. Falling back to the full fold is
    only half the fix — the pass must also leave the ack anchor where it was
    (``conclusive=False``), or the change we failed to read is consumed by the
    window that reported it and stays invisible until the backstop. Failing
    closed means failing SLOW, not failing quiet.

    Why it exists: the full fold costs one ``list_dir`` per ack dir per pass (280
    dirs on the live bus = ~336s at a remote host's 1.2s/op), even though at a
    20-min heartbeat ~0-2 shards actually change. So we ask the store what changed
    since ``since`` (the ack anchor — see ``ACKS_ANCHOR_KEY``), re-fold only those
    slugs, and reuse ``prior_acks`` — the prior aggregate rows' ``acked_by`` — for
    the rest, at zero ops.

    GC rides the full fold ONLY (see ``_full_fold_and_gc``): it is cleanup, not
    correctness, and the incremental path deliberately never lists the ack root,
    so it cannot see orphan dirs. It is deferred, not dropped — the periodic
    backstop (``DEFAULT_ACKS_FULL_EVERY``) collects within a bounded number of
