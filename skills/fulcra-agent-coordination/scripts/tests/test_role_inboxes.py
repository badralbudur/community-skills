"""Role inboxes in the READ folds — `briefing`, `inbox`, `needs-me`.

The contract is that `briefing` prints "your identity, role inboxes, and
everything that needs you" and that the fold is your work queue. For that to hold,
every read fold must expand a role assignee; otherwise a
role-addressed `tell` lands in the store, returns 0, and never surfaces for the
holder. These tests pin the promise.

The load-bearing one is the LAST group: a role lookup that fails is UNKNOWN, not
"no roles". If it folded to an empty held-role set the fold would render a clean,
role-blind queue indistinguishable from "you have no role work" — the same class
of silent failure, one layer down, and worse than the original bug because the
doc promise would then be true-except-when-it-silently-isn't.
