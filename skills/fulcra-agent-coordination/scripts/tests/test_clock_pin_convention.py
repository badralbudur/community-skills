"""Contract test: every test module that defines a module-level ``NOW`` also
pins the clock. Catches the date-boundary flake class at author time instead of
days later in someone else's CI.

The flake: a module fixes a ``NOW`` for its data, but the code under test computes
windows/staleness from the real clock (``cli._now()`` or a module ``_now``). Once
wall-clock time advances past ``NOW + window`` the suite flips red for good, and
it does so on a schedule nobody is watching. The remedy is an autouse fixture that
monkeypatches the relevant ``_now`` to a ``PINNED_NOW`` at/just after ``NOW``;
never weaken the assertion, derive relative ages from ``PINNED_NOW``.

This guard makes the next unpinned NOW-module fail here, immediately: for every
``tests/test_*.py`` that carries a top-level ``NOW =`` / ``_NOW =`` literal, it
requires the module to also contain a ``monkeypatch.setattr(<mod>, "_now", ...)``
— satisfied by the autouse fixture or by an in-body clock move (a test that moves
time pins its own ``_now``, which is still a pin). A module that genuinely must
run against the real clock goes in ``_CLOCK_PIN_EXEMPT`` with a reason.

Cheap-beats-clever: grep the tracked test files, match two regexes.
